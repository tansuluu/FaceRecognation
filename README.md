# FaceRecognation
Designing and Implementation Face Recognition application for AIU
The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each other. All people have the ability to recognize people by their faces. However, it takes a long time for a person to identify an individual from a photograph among thousands of others. The proposed solution is to develop a working prototype of a system that will facilitate the control of the university for the Administration of Ala-Too International University by detecting the front sides of students from photographs taken from surveillance cameras or external parties. The second part of the system will also be able to perform face recognition on the student database. For a good result, you need photos of excellent quality, while developing a project, requirements for photos are written to the database will also be worked out.
